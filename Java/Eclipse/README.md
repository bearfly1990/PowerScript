### Run Eclipse with a JDK

Maven requires Eclipse using a JDK, i.e. Java Development Kit, instead of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The main difference is that a JDK also contains a Java Compiler and other tools to develop Java Code, while the JRE is only able to run compiled Java applications.

#### To check with what Java version (JRE or JDK) Eclipse is running, do the following:

    Open the menu item Help > About Eclipse. (On the Mac, it’s in the Eclipse-menu, not the Help-menu)
    Click on Installation Details.
    Switch to the tab Configuration
    Search for a line that starts with -vm. The line following it shows which Java binary is used.

#### Depending on the name and location of the used Java binary one can figure out if a JRE or a JDK is used:

    If the path contains “jre” (e.g. as in C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\client\jvm.dll) it is a JRE
    If the path contains “jdk” (e.g. as in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_31\bin\javaw.exe) it is a JDK.

#### If no JDK is used for Eclipse, change it:

    Quit Eclipse if it is running
    Go to the Eclipse installation directory and open the file eclipse.ini in a text editor.
    Search for the line -vmargs

    Before the line -vmargs, add two lines:

    On the first line, write -vm

    On the second line, write the path to your JDK installation (usually something like: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_31\bin\javaw.exe on Windows)
